# AnagramCProgram
This is a C program to generate anagram for a given string and the code calculates total time to generate the anagrams

Don't input lengthy strings, because it can take very long time to generate all the possble anagrams.

The basic theory is that a string has n characters, so mathematically maximum number of anagrams can be craeted in n!
